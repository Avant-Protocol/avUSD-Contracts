## Audit scope

`AvUSD.sol`
`AvUSDMinting.sol` and the contract it extends, `SingleAdminAccessControl.sol`
`StakedAvUSDV2.sol`, the contract it extends, `StakedAvUSD.sol` and the additional contract it creates `AvUSDSilo.sol`

## Gitbook
To get an overview of Avant, please visit our gitbook: _TBD_

## Goals

The goal of Avant is to offer a permissionless stablecoin, avUSD, to defi users and to offer users yield for being in our ecosystem. Unlike USDC where Circle captures the yield, holders can stake their avUSD in exchange to receive savUSD, which increases in value relative to avUSD as the protocol earns yield. (Similar to rETH increasing in value with respect to ETH)

## How Avant generated yield

Users mint avUSD with stETH (?), and Avant opens an equivalent short ETH perps position on perps exchanges. stETH yields 3-4% annualized, while short ETH perps yield 6-8%. The combined long and short position daily yield is sent to an insurance fund, and then sent to the staking contract every 8 hours.

## How we maintain delta neutrality

The long stETH and short ETH perps creates a position with value that's fixed to the time of it's creation. Imagine ETH = $2000, user sends in 10 stETH to mint 20000 AvUSD, and Avant shorts 10 ETH worth of perps.

If the market goes down 90%, the long 10 stETH position is now worth $2000, down from $20000. While the short 10 ETH perps position has an unrealized P&L of $18000. If the user wishes to redeem his avUSD, the short perps position can be closed to realize $18000 of profits, and buy 90 stETH. Along with the original 10 stETH, the user is returned 100 stETH, also worth $20000.

## Our 3 Smart contracts

### AvUSD.sol

`AvUSD.sol` is the contract of our stablecoin. It extends `ERC20Burnable`, `ERC20Permit` and `Ownable2Step` from OpenZeppelin. There's a single variable, the `minter` address that can be modified by the `OWNER`. Outside of `Ownable2Step` contract owner only has one custom function, the ability to set the `minter` variable to any address.

The `minter` address is the only address that has the ability to mint avUSD. This minter address has one of the most powerful non-owner permissions, the ability to create an unlimited amount of avUSD. It will always be pointed to the `AvUSDMinting.sol` contract.

### AvUSDMinting.sol

`AvUSDMinting.sol` is the contract and address that the `minter` variable in `AvUSD.sol` points to. When users mint avUSD with stETH (or other collateral) or redeems collateral for avUSD, this contract is invoked.

The primary functions used in this contract is `mint()` and `redeen()`. Users who call this contract are all within avUSD. When outside users wishes to mint or redeem, they perform an EIP712 signature based on an offchain price we provided to them. They sign the order and sends it back to Avant's backend, where we run a series of checks and are the ones who take their signed order and put them on chain.

By design, Avant will be the only ones calling `mint()`,`redeen()` and other functions in this contract.

### Minting

In the `mint()` function, `order` and `signature` parameters comes from users who wishes to mint and performed the EIP 712 signature. `route` is generated by Avant, where it defines where the incoming collateral from users go to. The address in `route` we defined must be inside `_custodianAddresses` as a safety check, to ensure funds throughout the flow from users end up in our custodians within a single transaction. Only `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can add custodian address.

### Redeeming

Similar to minting, user performs an EIP712 signature with prices avUSD defined. We then submit their signature and order into `redeem()` function. The funds from redemption comes from the minting contract directly. Avant aims to hold between $100k-$200k worth of collateral at all times for hot redemptions. This mean for users intending to redeem a large amount, they will need to redeem over several blocks. Alternatively they can sell avUSD on the open market.

### Setting delegated signer

Some users trade through smart contracts. AvUSD minting has the ability to delegate signers to sign for an address, using `setDelegatedSigner`. The smart contract should call this function with the desired EOA address to delegate signing to. To remove delegation, call `removeDelegatedSigner`. Multiple signers can be delegated at once, and it can be used by EOA addresses as well.

By setting a delegated signer, the smart contract allows both the `order.benefactor` and delegated signed to be the address that's ecrecovered from the order and signature, rather than just `order.benefactor`.

#### Security

`AvUSDMinting.sol` have crucial roles called the `MINTER` and `REDEEMER`. Starting with `MINTER`, in our original design, they have the ability to mint any amount of AvUSD for any amount of collateral. Given `MINTER` is a hot wallet and is an EOA address, we considered the scenario where this key becomes compromised. An attacker could then mint a billion AvUSD for no collateral, and dump them on pools, causing a black swan event our insurance fund cannot cover.

Our solution is to enforce an on chain mint and redeem limitation of 100k avUSD per block. In addition, we have `GATEKEEPER` roles with the ability to disable mint/redeems and remove `MINTERS`,`REDEEMERS`. `GATEKEEPERS` acts as a safety layer in case of compromised `MINTER`/`REDEEMER`. They will be run in seperate AWS accounts not tied to our organisation, constantly checking each transaction on chain and disable mint/redeems on detecting transactions at prices not in line with the market. In case compromised `MINTERS` or `REDEEMERS` after this security implementation, a hacker can at most mint 100k avUSD for no collateral, and redeem all the collateral within the contract (we will hold ~$200k max), for a max loss of $300k in a single block, before `GATEKEEPER` disable mint and redeem. The $300k loss will not materialy affect our operations.

Further down the line, there has been considerations to give external organisations a `GATEKEEPER` role. We expect the external organisations to only invoke the gatekeeper functions when price errors occur on chain. Abuse of this privilege means their `GATEKEEPER` role will be removed.

The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, also our avUSD multisig, is required to re-enable minting/redeeming. `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` also has the power to add/remove `GATEKEEPERS`,`MINTER` and `REDEEMER`.

`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is the most powerful role in the minting contract, but is still beneath the `OWNER` role of `AvUSD.sol`, given that the owner can remove the minting contract's privilege to mint.

### StakedAvUSDV2.sol

`StakedAvUSDV2.sol` is where holders of avUSD stablecoin can stake their stablecoin, get savUSD in return and earn yield. Our protocol's yield is paid out by having a `REWARDER` role of the staking contract send yield in avUSD, increasing the savUSD value with respect to avUSD.

This contract is a modification of the ERC4626 standard, with a change to vest in rewards linearly over 8 hours to prevent users frontrunning the payment of yield, then unwinding their position right after (or even in the same block). This is also the reason for `REWARDER` role. Otherwise users can be denied rewards if random addresses send in 1 wei and modifies the rate of reward vesting.

There's also an additional change to add a 14 day cooldown period on unstaking savUSD. When the unstake process is initiated, from the user's perspective, savUSD is burnt immediately, and they will be able to invoke the withdraw function after cooldown is up to get their avUSD in return. Behind the scenes, on burning of savUSD, avUSD is sent to a seperate silo contract to hold the funds for the cooldown period. And on withdrawal, the staking contract moves user funds from silo contract out to the user's address. The cooldown is configurable up to 90 days.

Due to legal requirements, there's a `SOFT_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE` and `FULL_RESTRICTED_STAKER_ROLE`. The former is for addresses based in countries we are not allowed to provide yield to, for example USA. Addresses under this category will be soft restricted. They cannot deposit avUSD to get savUSD or withdraw savUSD for avUSD. However they can participate in earning yield by buying and selling savUSD on the open market.

`FULL_RESTRCITED_STAKER_ROLE` is for sanction/stolen funds, or if we get a request from law enforcement to freeze funds. Addresses fully restricted cannot move their funds, and only Avant can unfreeze the address. Avant also has the ability to repossess funds of an address fully restricted. We understand having the ability to freeze and repossess funds of any address Avant chooses could be a cause of concern for defi users' decisions to stake avUSD. While we aim to make our operations as secure as possible, interacting with Avant still requires a certain amount of trust in our organisation outside of code on the smart contract, given the tie into cefi to earn yield.

Note this restriction only applies to staking contract, there are no restrictions or ability to freeze funds of the avUSD stablecoin, unlike USDC.

## Owner of Avant's smart contracts

Avant utilises a gnosis safe multisig to hold ownership of its smart contracts. All multisig keys are cold wallets. We will require 7/10 or more confirmations before transactions are approved. This multisig is purely for the purpose of owning the smart contracts, and will not hold funds or do other on chain actions.
